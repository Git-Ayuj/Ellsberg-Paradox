# Ellsberg-Paradox
We have developed a web-application to simulate the infamous ambiguity aversion game. We have provided the user with two options where, in the first option, the probability of an event happening is clearly defined. However, in the second option, the probability is not described and it is kept ambiguous.

Installation

First, you need to install Python (version >= 3.9.5).
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder.
Create a virtual environment using the command -
 
python -m venv env

 
Activate the virtual environment created
On Linux/MacOS, you can run -

On Windows PowerShell, you can run -

Open the web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/. The website should be up and running.
